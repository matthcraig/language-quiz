## Setup/Installation Requirements

_For an initial look, if the above requirements are met, you can view the pages code through the github repositories. For a more in depth look, you may need to install a code editing tool such as visual studio code or atom. Once that code editing software is installed, you may download the repository and open the html file, and it will open in your default browser as it would look when published to the web. It should be noted that this tactic is untested on smartphones and tablets._
